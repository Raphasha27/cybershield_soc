## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v18.x or higher)
-   npm (v9.x or higher)
-   Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Steps to Run
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Raphasha27/cybershield-modern.git
    cd cybershield-modern
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4.  **Access the Application**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

## 📊 Live Simulation
The application includes a built-in simulation engine (`SecurityService`) that generates:
-   Fluctuating threat levels based on random heuristic patterns.
-   A continuous stream of security logs in the integrated terminal.
-   Machine Learning model training simulations and identity scanning results.
-   Interactive Chart.js updates upon view switching.

## 📝 Modernization Details
This version represents a significant architectural upgrade from the original vanilla JS implementation:
-   **Encapsulation**: Logical components are managed via standalone Angular components.
-   **Reactivity**: Signals ensure the UI stays in perfect sync with the security data without expensive change detection cycles.
-   **Enterprise Ready**: Integrated features for personal data checkups and machine learning status monitoring.
